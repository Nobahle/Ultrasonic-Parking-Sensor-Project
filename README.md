# Ultrasonic-Parking-Sensor-Project
This repository contains the Arduino code for an ultrasonic parking sensor project using the HC-SR04 distance sensor. The project measures distance and illuminates LEDs accordingly.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
Measures distance and displays using LEDs
Arduino-based project

SETUP
Connect HC-SR04 distance sensor to Arduino
Connect LEDs to Arduino
Upload code to Arduino

USAGE
Power on Arduino
LEDs will illuminate based on distance measured
